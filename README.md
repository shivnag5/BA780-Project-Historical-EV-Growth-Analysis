# Problem Definition: 
Electric vehicles have increased in popularity since their introduction in the early 2010’s. The USA has been one of the top producing and consuming countries in this market since its birth. The electric vehicle market is advancing rapidly in some parts of the world, such as Europe and China. However, the American market is still far from reaching its full potential. Therefore, by analyzing the dataset, we can understand some of the reasons for the current state of the electric car market in the United States. We aim to uncover trends and insights into the factors driving EV adoption. This analysis will highlight the impact of infrastructure development on consumer behavior, state policies, and overall market potential.

# Data Sources: 
his is the link to the U.S. Department of Energy’s database of alternative fueling stations in the U.S., starting in 2024: EV Stations (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fafdc.energy.gov%2Fstations%2Fstates)

This site provides information into different states and the number of EV registration over time. The years vary, but we will select years that each state has information for: EV Registration (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atlasevhub.com%2Fmaterials%2Fstate-ev-registration-data%2F%23data)

This is a third source that we gathered later for the purpose of comparing some infrastructure across the United States. This allowed for a country wide view. We did not use this source originally, because the information provided was clean and well organized. However, it was helpful in driving the business insights we were pursuing: Additional Infrastructure and Registration Data (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fafdc.energy.gov%2Fvehicle-registration%3Fyear%3D2023)

Motivation: We’re interested in observing the market trends for EV’s starting at a macroeconomic level and conducting further sub-analyses on specific states and regions which provide key insights into this area of the automotive industry. Charging stations, state/region, and vehicle purchases will be some of the KPIs we will analyze.
